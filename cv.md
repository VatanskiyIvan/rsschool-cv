**About me:**
* I want to learn how to code.
* I know a tiny bit of HTML\CSS\JS (7 kyu on codewars).
* I have finished 11 grades at school
* Almous every piece of information that i get from internet is in english language, but i barely ever talk in english, and i struggle to understand english people when they talk about complicated things like science.
