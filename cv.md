**About me:**
* I want to learn how to code.

* I have finished 11 grades at school and these courses:
  * https://ru.code-basics.com/languages/javascript
  * https://htmlacademy.ru/
  * https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design
  * https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#basic-javascript
  * https://learn.javascript.ru/first-steps
* Almous every piece of information that i get from internet is in english language, but i barely ever talk in english, and i struggle to understand english people when they talk about complicated things like science.
